## About blog

👋 Welcome to my corner of the web.
Here, I document the hurdles I hit in projects, the things that spark my curiosity, and the traces of where I've been — books, trips, and the people along the way.

## About me

Hello everyone~ My name is Donghai and I am from China. I’m currently based in Shanghai, and for the past few years, I’ve been deeply involved with MS Dynamics CRM. I’ve worked on several projects, focusing on application support, solution design, and system development for customer relationship management systems. From coding to business processes, from gathering requirements to delivering solutions—I’ve seen my fair share of challenges, but I’ve also learned to navigate them. I enjoy finding smooth solutions in complex systems and making cold technology truly serve people’s needs.
