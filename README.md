# About this repository

A blog built based on [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/rickeygong/hugo-PaperMod), with some styles modified according to personal preferences.

Most of the styling modifications I made reference the [Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme because it looks so great.
